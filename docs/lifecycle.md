# Development Lifecycle in Auth0

__Development__, __Test__, __Q&A__ environments are easy to create in Auth0. You simply create a new account for each. This guarantees maximum isolation between them. You can easily switch between accounts using the account chooser on the top right menu on the dashboard. You can also have different administrative accounts in each.

The example above uses a simple naming convention to distinguish one environment from the other.

Through the API you can automate migrating assets between one account and the other (e.g. rules, database connections, etc.).

For easier configuration management we recommend you use settings kept in the dashboard as opposed to hardcoded in your __rules__ or __db connections__ scripts.

For example, in this __rule__ it is always better to write:

```
function(user, context, callback){
	var log_url = configuration.log_url;	
...
}
```

than:

```
function(user, context, callback){
	var log_url = ‘https://someurl/log’;	
...
}
```

Very likely this URL will change from development to production. This will make your code more portable.

You can also maintain the source code of the rules in a GitHub repository. If you choose the GitHub integration route, the rules in your Auth0 account will be automatically updated whenever a change is submitted to the GitHub repository. To configure this integration see [here](rules#8).
